Closer to Future.

Hello there,

We are CAS, a collective of passionate individuals—Sangjin Kim, Seonkyo Kim, Sejin Kim, and Geunwoo Bae—united by a shared vision to enhance and refine our abilities as programmers.

At CAS, we embrace a bottom-up learning approach, building knowledge from foundational elements to abstract concepts. With this philosophy at our core, we have created a unique ‘system’ that integrates multiple models to guide our growth and innovation.

Through exploration, collaboration, and hands-on experience, we aim to not only develop our technical skills but also cultivate a deeper understanding of the principles that drive modern programming.

Join us on this journey as we learn, grow, and create something extraordinary together.
